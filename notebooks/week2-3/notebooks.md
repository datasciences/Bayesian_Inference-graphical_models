# Weekly Notebooks

# week 1
 

* Bayes theorem, posterior probability, Cookie problem
1. https://github.com/AllenDowney/ThinkBayes2/tree/master/code

* Pymc3
2. 

First we will learn how to calculate posterior probability using python. Further, we will use a python package called pymc3 and see how bayesian inference can be done.

Reference: Exercise from Think Bayes book. Chapter 1 and 2. Bayesian data analysis, Oswaldo Martin and Pymc3 website

# week 2
* Sampling and Variational Inference
1. https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1pgfT_sdoyNoYKxr_5SHYDm7yS1ANNI0e

* Introduction to Pyro
2. https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1FvNCbnu16evlCXyxxzNPf1uHUkVkDSFJ

Second week, we will work code all the sampling and variational methods using pure python or pymc3 and look at the difference between them. Further, we will start with a more recent and advanced python package Pyro by facebook. We will learn how to write a stochastic model, how to infer single parameter model, joint probability model and conditional probability model. This can take quite sometime. So be prepared and finish it at your own pace. 

Reference: Exercise from various sources including statistical rethinking, Bayesian data analysis and Ravin Kumar's blog(http://canyon289.github.io/). I compiled codes from all these sources and put this in a colab link.
