Brms Overview
--------
Welcome to my brms learnings. 

I'm going to read/work through the chapters in this [[project]](https://bookdown.org/ajkurz/Statistical_Rethinking_recoded/) which has implementations of the book "Statistical rethinking". The book has codes implemented in R package brms and Python package Pymc3. I plan to switch between brms and pymc3. One of the core reason for doing this is, I want to stick with Bayesian using python in the long run, whereas I wanted to understand deeply some of the work I did using brms. Brms is a great tool for quickly building machine learning models. By integrating shiny-R, they also have amazing visualization of results that brms produce for checking convergence, posterior probability distributions etc. 

You can check out my general bayesian theory learning from my [[Theory repository]](https://github.com/vvrahul11/Bayesian_ml_dl_workout_area/tree/master/theory)

Check out the amazing books from where I'm going to learn bayesian machine learning.
