# Random basic notes

Uncertainity estimation in machine learning, deep learning and reinforcement learning methods are increasingly becoming popular due to the latest research advancements in variational inference and dropout. Reading several blogs on the web made me feel that the field is still in it's infacncy, although a lot of talented researchers, statisticians and programmers are working hard to cater the advantages of bayesian estimation to a wider audiene. 

With the availability of several Python and R packages and bayesian statistics books, it is good to learn the theory, then practice and implement solutions for already existing problems. I envision to use the theory and practical knowledge I would gain on projects my company would work in the future. 

After an extensive search, I found the following books are highly popular in this field. 

* Information Theory, Inference, and Learning Algorithms
* Gaussian process for machine learning
* pattern recognition and machine learning
* Statistical rethinking
* Bayesian analysis with python
* [[Probability theory: The logic of science]](https://github.com/terryum/awesome-deep-learning-papers)
* Bayesian data analysis
* Think Bayes



## Day 1

I have been working on building and analysing bayesian models over a month by today. I am currently using r package brms to build bayesian regression model and interpret the results. As I tried to dig the chapters deeper, i came to realize that there are several topics in bayesian statistics that I have no clue about. My real aim of delving in to bayesian field was that I wanted to learn and use bayesian deep learning models in my company projects. I spent several hours going through different blogs, text books and youtube videos. I skimmed through brms, Pymc3, Pyro and gpytorch official website tutorials. 

I'm currently working on reading Think Bayes book and complementing the theoretical part randomly using "pattern recognition and machine learning", "Information Theory, Inference, and Learning Algorithms" books.

I completed most of the theory and practical part of chapter 1 of Think Bayes. 

## Day 2

Today I started reading about Variational inference and how it is faster than Markov chain monte carlo approach for sampling.
