# Bayesian machine learning and deep learning workout area with Brms, Pymc3, Pyro and Gpytorch

Uncertainity estimation in machine learning, deep learning and reinforcement learning methods are increasingly becoming popular due to the latest research advancements in variational inference and dropout. Reading several blogs on the web made me feel that the field(deep learning with Bayesian) is still in it's infacncy, although a lot of talented researchers, statisticians and programmers are working hard to cater the advantages of bayesian estimation to a wider audiene. 

With the availability of several Python and R packages and bayesian statistics books, it is good to learn the theory, then practice and implement solutions for already existing problems. I envision to use the theory and practical knowledge I would gain on projects my company would work in the future. 

After an extensive search, I found the following books are highly popular in this field. 

* Information Theory, Inference, and Learning Algorithms
* Gaussian process for machine learning
* pattern recognition and machine learning
* Statistical rethinking
* Bayesian analysis with python
* [[Probability theory: The logic of science]](https://github.com/terryum/awesome-deep-learning-papers)
* Bayesian data analysis
* Think Bayes


Overview 
--------
There will be several folders and subfolders in this repository. 

* A summary of the most important theory will go into [[theory folder]](https://github.com/vvrahul11/Bayesian_ml_dl_workout_area/tree/master/theory)
* All basic statistical exercises from think bayes will go into [[stats folder]](https://github.com/vvrahul11/Bayesian_ml_dl_workout_area/tree/master/stats)
* All practical exercises using machine learning will go into folder [[ml]](https://github.com/vvrahul11/Bayesian_ml_dl_workout_area/tree/master/ml)
* All practical exercises using deep learning will go into folder [[dl]](https://github.com/vvrahul11/Bayesian_ml_dl_workout_area/tree/master/dl)
* Both ml and dl folders will contain subfolders with examples, inference from R and python libraries such as Pymc3, Brms, Pyro, gpytorch or Botorch.
